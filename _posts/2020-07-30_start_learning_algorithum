Algorithum/Data structure was not needed in my short period of carrer
Starting to handle bigger data, the need of Algorithum/Data structure is increaseing 

I'll be handling few Algorithum/Data Structure to get deeper understanding with the help of Python 
Let's start learning/reviving algorithum from the beginng 

목차  What I'll be studying :

1. hash-map : 해시 맵 

2. sorting 정렬

3. dynamic programming 동적 계획법

4. graph 그래프

5. stack/queue 스택/큐

6. Brute-Force search 완전 탐색

7. DFS(Depth-first search) /BFS(Breadth-first search)  깊이/너비 우선 탐색

8. heap 힙

9. greedy 탐욕법

10. binary search 이분탐색
